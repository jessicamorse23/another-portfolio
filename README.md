# Another Portfolio for Jessica Morse

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio using React. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I ran into some challenges with this project - namely getting the project to deploy via 
GitHub pages. I ended up having to create a new repository and React app for this purpose. You can find the original repository - with commit history - here: <br>

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
